# Thin-Airfoil-Theory-GUI
This repo contains the code written by a group of 3 people for our course AE244 (Low Speed Aerodynamics)

The jupyter notebook is divided into 3 cells: 
- The first cell should be run ONLY ONCE as it downloads the required libraries for the graphic user interface
- The next cell contains all the function definitions used in our code
- The last cell contains the function definition of the gui and the main code to run the gui

Do maximize the gui for a good user experience.

The first window is scrollable to see the Cl vs alpha plot button
